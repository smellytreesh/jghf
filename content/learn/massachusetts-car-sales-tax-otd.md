Massachusetts' state sales tax is **6.25%** for vehicle purchases from registered dealers. Your *out‑the‑door (OTD) price* also includes title/registration fees and any dealer documentation fees. Always compare dealers using a **written buyer’s order** with VIN and line items so totals are apples‑to‑apples.

> Note: Taxes and fees can change; confirm with the MA Department of Revenue and RMV before you sign.
