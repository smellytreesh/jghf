The **OTD price** is the real, final amount you will pay to leave with the car. It includes:

- Vehicle price
- Sales tax
- Title & registration fees
- Dealer documentation fees
- Only the add‑ons you explicitly approve

**Tip:** Request a written buyer’s order with VIN and line items to compare offers.
